# Antenna Design and Analysis

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and results for designing and analyzing a patch antenna.

## Files
- `patch_antenna_design.m`: MATLAB script for calculating antenna parameters and analyzing S11, gain, and radiation patterns.
- `S11_Plot.png`: Reflection coefficient plot (S11).
- `3D Radiation Pattern at 2.4 GHz.png`: 3D radiation pattern at the resonant frequency.
- `Gain and Elevation Plane Directivity at 2.4GHz.png`: Elevation plane directivity.

## Requirements
- MATLAB with Antenna Toolbox.
- Tested with MATLAB R2023a.

## Usage
1. Run `patch_antenna_design.m` in MATLAB.
2. View results and export them for further analysis or fabrication.
